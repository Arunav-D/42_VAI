This removes barriers to starting.\\n\\n- Give her space to work on projects while periodically checking in to show you care. Ask open-ended questions about what she's learning or how she's feeling.\\n\\n- Connect Olivia with peers, mentors, or instructors knowledgeable about areas that motivate her like visual arts, building things, sports etc. Having role models can inspire passion.\\n\\n- Identify local events, competitions, or summer programs where Olivia could showcase her talents if she becomes interested in that later on. \\n\\n- Most importantly, prioritize understanding her perspective and goals first before pushing your own agenda.
