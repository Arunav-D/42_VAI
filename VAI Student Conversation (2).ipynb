Reflect on your general strengths - are you more analytical or creative? Do you prefer math, science, writing, etc? Align to those tendencies.  \\n\\n3. Consider future goals - if you might want a sports journalism career for example, choose English and writing classes to focus on. Think long-term.\\n\\n4. Identify any current event, player or football concept you find super fascinating right now. See which academic subjects could explore those in depth.  \\n\\n5. Talk to teachers in your stronger subjects first - ask if they're open to you taking a football lens. Their flexibility matters. \\n\\n6. Don't overcommit - pick maybe 1 or 2 flexible teachers/classes to start. Expand later once you have momentum.\\n\\nThe most important criteria are your innate strengths and interests, along with teacher flexibility.
