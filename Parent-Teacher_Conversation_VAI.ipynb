This might help nurture his interest in a way that holds his attention a bit more. We could brainstorm ideas ranging from model buildings to basic masonry skills like mixing cement or laying bricks. \\n\\nI'd also be happy to share tips with Claude's teachers on keeping him engaged in class through letting him take movement breaks, connecting content to his interests, and providing hands-on applications of concepts. My goal is to find a good balance between nurturing Claude's passion and working on his ability to focus for longer periods.\\n\\nDoes this kind of supportive approach resonate with you?

Hands-on learning is great!\\n\\n- Encourage Claude to research types of bricks, brick bonds, and famous brick structures. Learning terminology and concepts can fuel passion.\\n\\n- Check if there are any local masons willing to let Claude job shadow for a day or volunteer on a basic project site. Immersive learning brings concepts to life.\\n\\nMy role is to supplement the support you provide as his parent with specialized guidance related to his interests.
